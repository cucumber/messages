    #  The [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of a Gherkin document.
    #  Cucumber implementations should *not* depend on `GherkinDocument` or any of its
    #  children for execution - use [Pickle](#io.cucumber.messages.Pickle) instead.
    #
    #  The only consumers of `GherkinDocument` should only be formatters that produce
    #  "rich" output, resembling the original Gherkin document.
