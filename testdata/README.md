Test Data
=========

This folder contains (one) interesting sample to test serialization and
deserialization. It covers attribute casing, enum representation, optional
values and numbers.

This sample set is intentionally not exhaustive. As the message implementations
are generated we are only interested in structural problems. A more exhaustive
set of test data can be found in the [compatibility-kit](https://github.com/cucumber/compatibility-kit).

Note: because the compatibility-kit depends on messages, we can't use it
to test itself.
